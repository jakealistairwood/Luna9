                <div>
                    <p>There are four main components to batteries; An anode, cathode, liquid electrolyte and a separator.</p>
                    <p>The negative anode releases electrons during an electrochemical reaction while the positive cathode acquires them. The separator’s function is to prevent physical contact between the anode and cathode while allowing the ions to pass through. The liquid electrolyte acts as a highway allowing the ions to move back and forth.</p>

                <p>Thanks to their amazing power output and convenient portability, Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionised the way that we live, work and travel. Weight-for-weight, Li-ion batteries can store 6x the amount of energy1 than their lead-acid rivals, making them the clear choice in our constant search for electric power on the move, but what are their limitations?</p>

            <h2>How innovative solutions could power the future</h2>
            <p>Exciting innovations are on the horizon, with the potential to revolutionise batteries and how we use them, here are a few we’re particularly excited about.</p>
        </header>
        <div class="innovative-solutions">
            <div class="innovative-solutions__solution silicon-without-the-cons">
                <img src="./assets/img/Button battery-2.svg" alt="battery-cell">
                <h5>Silicon without the cons</h5>
                <p>Silicon lithium ion batteries use a silicon anode to create higher energy density. One small problem? Silicon swells by 300% when charged. Enovix have solved these growing pains with an innovative constraint system that stops the battery from going supersized. It means 50% more energy than what’s on the market and lighter electronics with longer battery life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="innovative-solutions__solution solid-state">
                <img src="./assets/img/Button battery-2.svg" alt="battery-cell">
                <h5>Solid state</h5>
                <p>Lithium metal anodes offer significantly more energy density than their carbon based cousins, but lithium tends to react with the liquid electrolyte, causing it to degrade, short-circuit, or even explode. Quantumscape’s solution is to swap the liquid with a solid ceramic electrolyte that lets the ions pass through it just as easily. The outcome? Higher energy density, lower cost, longer life and enhanced safety.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="innovative-solutions__solution sustainable-solutions">
                <img src="./assets/img/Button battery-2.svg" alt="battery-cell">
                <h5>Sustainable Solutions</h5>
                <p>Sodium ion batteries offer a cheap, abundant, and environmentally friendly alternative to their contentious lithium counterparts. But limited energy density and a much shorter cycle life have held them back. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are changing this with a new electrolyte recipe and a design that holds 90% of its capacity after 300 cycles. It’s also impervious to temperature changes and can operate at high voltages making it an increasingly viable and stable option.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="innovative-solutions__solution seaweed-seperator">
                <img src="./assets/img/Button battery-2.svg" alt="battery-cell">
                <h5>Seaweed Seperator</h5>
                <p>A team from the University of Bristol are using nanomaterials from seaweed as a solution to the dendrite growth that causes sodium metal batteries to short-circuit. Not only does the innovative separator stop the crystals but it also improves the performance of the batteries. Enhancing our capability to move away from the scarce materials and unethical practices linked to Lithium ion batteries.</p>

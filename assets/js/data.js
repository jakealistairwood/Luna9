        inventedBy: 'Alessandro Volta',
        location: 'Italy',
        voltageOutput: '0.76V per cell',
        date: 1800,
        additionalInfo: "Volta was inspired by the electric eel's organ and its natural ability to create, store, and discharge electricity. The first true battery was created in a similar structure using copper and zinc discs, seperated by brine-soaked cloth to enhance conductivity. It produced a stable, consistent current for a short time, paving the way for batteries as we know them today.",

        location: 'Britain',
        voltageOutput: '1.1V',
        date: 1820,
        additionalInfo: 'The Daniell Cell was developed as a safer and more stable alternative to the Voltaic Pile. Also known as the porous pot cell, it consists of a zinc anode submerged in an earthenware pot containing zinc sulphate solution, which was then in turn placed into a copper can containing copper sulphate solution. The Copper pot acted as the batterys cathode.',

        voltageOutput: '2V',
        date: 1859,
        additionalInfo: 'Up until this point, the pioneers of electrochemistry had created primary cells - single-use sources of power which are drained once the chemical reactions are complete. The lead acid battery changed everything, as its chemical reaction can be reversed - a discovery that brought about the amazing practicalities of rechargeability. This technology is still used to start most internal combustion engine cars today.',

        location: 'France',
        voltageOutput: '1.5V',
        date: 1866,
        additionalInfo: "Leclanche's first version of the carbon-zinc cell provided a source of power with a much longer shelf life, thanks to the addition of carbon to the cathode. He later reworked his invention by adding starch to the electrolyte to turn it into a gelatinous paste and sealed it with wax, thus creating a 'dry' and - most importantly - portable source of power. Carbon-Zinc cells existed as a primary source of energy into the 1950s.",

        location: 'Sweden',
        voltageOutput: '1.2V',
        date: 1899,
        additionalInfo: 'Created to rival the lead-acid cell, which was proving to be bulky in size but lacking in power, the NiCd cell developed by Jungner was robust, fast to change and offered a higher energy density than the older lead-acid tech. However, Cadmium is highly toxic, meaning that the cells needed to be carefully sealed and still presented a risk. This was revolutionised in the 1990s with the adaptation of nickel-metal-hydride to reduce toxicity, and these types of cells are still widely used today.',

        voltageOutput: '1.5V',
        date: 1959,
        additionalInfo: "Although alkaline electrolytes were nothing new by this time in the battery's history (for example Thomas Edison famously created an alkaline storage battery in 1901), the modern and widespread use of alkaline cells is thanks to an engineer at the Everready Battery Company. Tasked to find a life-extending solution for Carbon-Zinc batteries, Urry developed a prototype that used zinc powder instead of foil. He showcased his invention using toy cars, easily outlasting the leading competitor.",

        date: 1992,
        additionalInfo: "First patented in 1985 and commercialised by Sony in 1991, the lithium-ion cell is the product of decades of work in materials science, searching for the right compounds to create supremely lightweight, compact and powerful cells to power portable electronics. It was no mean feat - research into Li-ion tech has been supported by no less than eight Nobel laureates. Today, Lithium-ion batteries power all the personal devices that we couldn't live without - from smartphones and laptops all the way to electric vehicles and even prototype aircraft.",
